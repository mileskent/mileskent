# Hi! 😺

I'm an undergrad Computer Science major at Georgia Tech 🐝 interested in studying the first principles and formalisms that facilitate engineering and describe the natural world.

My interests within Computer Science all revolve around
* formalisms that facilitate connections between disparate ideas and ensure 100% confidence guarantees
* abstractions that empower expressiveness and simplicity, especially with regards to transformation

These interests include but are not limited to: array programming languages, combinators & tacit programming, functional programming, programming paradigms, formal methods, low-level systems, computer graphics, computer hardware, optimization, and high-performance computing. 

My favorite programming languages in no particular order are C++, Rust 🦀, and Haskell. I really like mathematical syntax and algebraic data structures. I also really like formalisms that functional programming languages provide, because they make the invalid inexpressible and enable safe development with unbreakable guardrails that prevent disaster.

I am also interested in: Philosophy, Math, Physics, Linguistics, Urban Design, and Music.
